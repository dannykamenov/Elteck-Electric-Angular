# Elteck Electric Angular Project
 This is a project for SoftUni's Final Angular Exam! It is a completely original idea, built for a real client. This repo comes with two folders. One contains the front-end part of the project with TypeScript, SCSS and Angular. The server folder contains the back-end part - written in Node JS, Express.js and using Mongo DB as a database service. The project also uses Firebase's authentication api and storage api.

## How to set up?
* First, access each folder (elteck-angular-final & elteck-server) seperately in the terminal of your choice.
* Run "npm i" or "npm install" to download all the necessary packages.
